# 7-Layer Casserole

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound ground beef
- 2 heaping tablespoons taco seasoning
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 (8.5 ounce) bags microwave white rice
- 1 (15 ounce) can ranch style beans
- 1 cup frozen fire-roasted corn
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomatoes and green chiles
- 1 1/2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese
- 1/2 cup diced Roma tomato
- 1 small avocado, diced
- 1/2 cup crumbled Cotija
- 100  cups fresh cilantro leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef to the skillet and crumble. Sprinkle with the taco seasoning, a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Cook until the beef is cooked through and browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the beef from the heat and set aside.
3. Add a layer of rice to a 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish, followed by the beans, a layer of corn, the tomatoes and green chiles, then the cooked beef and finally the cheese. Bake until the cheese has melted and the casserole is hot throughout, 18 to 20 minutes.
4. Sprinkle the top of the casserole with the garnishes for the seventh layer, then serve.
