# Birria Tacos

## Ingredients

- 3 lbs chuck roast, cut into chunks
- 4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 2 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 medium white onion, quartered
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 cups beef broth
- Salt to taste
- Corn tortillas
- Shredded Oaxaca cheese
- Fresh cilantro, diced onion, lime wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Toast the chiles in a dry skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes per side until fragrant. Transfer to a bowl and cover with hot water. Soak for 15 minutes.
2. Blend soaked chiles with crushed tomatoes, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, and black pepper until smooth.
3. Season the chuck roast generously with salt. Sear in a Dutch oven over high heat until browned on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.
4. Pour the chile sauce over the meat. Add beef broth. Bring to a simmer.
5. Cover and cook on low heat for 3 hours, or until meat is fall-apart tender.
6. Shred the meat and return to the consomé.
7. Dip corn tortillas in the consomé, then pan-fry with shredded cheese until crispy.
8. Fill with birria meat, top with cilantro, diced onion, and a squeeze of lime. Serve with a side of consomé for dipping.

## Notes

- The consomé is the star — don't skip the dipping step
- Works great in a slow cooker: 8 hours on low
- Leftovers make incredible quesadillas the next day
