## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
- 1 cup sliced carrots
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- ½ cup sliced celery
- ⅓ cup butter
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- ⅓ cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon celery seed
- 1 ¾ cups chicken broth
- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 ½ cups gluten-free baking mix
- ½ cup cold butter, cubed
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- 1 tablespoon fresh chives, chopped

## Instructions

1. Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
2. Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.
3. While chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in gluten-free flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.
4. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.
5. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. Pour chicken and vegetables into a 9x13 baking dish. Pour hot broth mixture over top and stir to combine.
7. For the biscuit topping: combine baking mix and cold butter, cutting butter in until pea-sized. Stir in buttermilk and chives until just combined. Drop spoonfuls over the filling.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown and filling is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 GF flour works well here
- Don't overmix the biscuit dough — lumps are fine
