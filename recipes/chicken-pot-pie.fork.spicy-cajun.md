## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
- 6 oz andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 cup sliced carrots
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- ½ cup sliced celery
- ½ cup diced bell pepper
- ⅓ cup butter
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon cajun seasoning
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 ¾ cups chicken broth
- ⅔ cup milk
- 2 (9-inch) unbaked pie crusts

## Instructions

1. Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
2. Brown andouille sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside.
3. Combine chicken, carrots, peas, celery, and bell pepper in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.
4. While chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, cajun seasoning, salt, and cayenne pepper.
5. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.
6. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
7. Place chicken, sausage, and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot broth mixture over top.
8. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- Adjust cayenne to taste — start with ⅛ teaspoon if you prefer milder heat
- Smoked paprika can substitute for half the cajun seasoning for a smokier flavor
- Great with a side of cornbread
