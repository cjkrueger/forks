## Ingredients

- 1 (15 oz) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 8 oz cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 1 cup sliced carrots
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- ½ cup sliced celery
- ⅓ cup butter
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 ¾ cups vegetable broth
- ⅔ cup milk
- 2 (9-inch) unbaked pie crusts

## Instructions

1. Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
2. Combine chickpeas, mushrooms, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.
3. While vegetables are cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, and thyme.
4. Slowly stir in vegetable broth and milk.
5. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
6. Place chickpeas and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot broth mixture over top.
7. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
