## Ingredients

- 1 large head broccoli, cut into florets
- 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley
- 1 tbsp. freshly chopped rosemary
- 1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. To use a food processor, place florets in a large food processor and pulse until finely chopped.
2. To use a box grater, grate florets along the medium holes.

4. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add rice and cook until tender, 5 minutes. Add herbs and season with salt and pepper.
