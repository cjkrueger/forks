# Italian Penicillin Soup (Pastina Soup)

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1-1/2 cups chopped onion
- 1-1/2 cups chopped carrot
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 8 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 2-in. Parmesan rind, optional
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 cups cooked shredded chicken breast
- 1 cup uncooked pastina
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Minced fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrot and celery; cook until softened, 4-6 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. Stir in salt, thyme, oregano, parsley and pepper.
2. Add broth, Parmesan rind, if using, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat; cook until vegetables are soft, 25-30 minutes.
3. Remove Parmesan rind and bay leaf; discard. Use an immersion blender to puree the vegetables until smooth. Alternatively, transfer the vegetables and one cup of broth to a blender; puree until smooth. Return soup to the pot.
4. Stir in chicken; bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Add pastina; cook until pasta is al dente, 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in lemon juice.
5. Ladle soup into individual serving bowls; garnish with fresh chopped parsley to serve.
