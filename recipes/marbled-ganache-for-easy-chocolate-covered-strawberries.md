# Marbled Ganache for Easy Chocolate-Covered Strawberries

## Ingredients

- 3 ounces heavy cream (1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 85g)
- 2 ounces dark chocolate, about 72%, roughly chopped (1/3 cup; 55g)
- 2 ounces heavy cream (1/4 cup; 55g)
- 3 ounces white chocolate, about 35%, roughly chopped (1/2 cup; 85g)
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions

1. For the Dark Chocolate Ganache: In a 1-quart stainless steel saucier, bring the cream to a gentle simmer. When it's bubbling hard around the edges, pour over dark chocolate in a medium bowl. Let stand 30 seconds, then whisk gently to combine. Stand at room temperature until 85°F (29°C), about 8 minutes.
2. For the White Chocolate Ganache: In a 1-quart stainless steel saucier, bring the cream to a gentle simmer. When it's bubbling hard around the edges, pour over white chocolate in a medium bowl. Let stand 30 seconds, then add a pinch of salt and whisk gently to combine. Stand at room temperature until 85°F (28°C), about 8 minutes.
3. To Combine: Pour half the dark ganache into a small serving bowl, followed by half the white ganache. Then pour in half the remaining dark ganache, followed by half the remaining white ganache, then repeat. Swirl together with a toothpick and serve with fresh fruit, pretzels, shortbread cookies, or whatever you're inclined to dunk in chocolate.
