# Pasta Carbonara

## Ingredients

- 1 lb spaghetti
- 6 oz guanciale or pancetta, diced
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2 large whole eggs
- 1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.
2. While pasta cooks, cook guanciale in a cold skillet over medium heat until fat renders and meat is crispy, about 8 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole eggs, Pecorino, and Parmigiano. Add generous black pepper.
4. Drain pasta and add to the skillet with guanciale. Remove from heat.
5. Pour egg mixture over pasta, tossing quickly and constantly. The residual heat cooks the eggs into a creamy sauce. Add pasta water a splash at a time if needed.
6. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino and black pepper.

## Notes

- Never add cream — the egg and cheese IS the sauce
- Remove pan from heat before adding eggs to avoid scrambling
- Guanciale is traditional but pancetta works in a pinch
