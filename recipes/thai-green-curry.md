# Thai Green Curry

## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs chicken thighs, sliced
- 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
- 3 tbsp green curry paste
- 1 Japanese eggplant, sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup Thai basil leaves
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp palm sugar or brown sugar
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- Jasmine rice for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Scoop the thick cream from the top of the coconut milk into the pan.
2. When the cream begins to sizzle, add the curry paste and fry for 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. Add chicken and stir to coat in the curry paste. Cook for 3-4 minutes.
4. Pour in the remaining coconut milk. Add kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and sugar.
5. Add eggplant and bell pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender.
6. Stir in Thai basil just before serving.
7. Serve over jasmine rice.

## Notes

- Mae Ploy is a solid store-bought curry paste
- Swap chicken for shrimp or tofu for variation
- Add bamboo shoots or baby corn if you have them
